# BOOK SCRAPING PAGE

 The idea in this project is to get data from a web book page and use the information in my application, this practice is known as scraping.
First to structure the project, my application will receive the data and download when executed, then I will implement search on more sites develop the frontend interface.

 I used PHP to implement a web scraping solution, employing CSS and XPath (XML Path Language) selectors, and making HTTP requests to fetch data from the web page.
